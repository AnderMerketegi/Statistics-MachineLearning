# Shiny for Python - Measuring Sensitivity of Central Tendency Measures to Outliers

In order to run the Shiny app, the first step is to install all the dependencies.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once all the packages and dependencies are installed, we can run the Shiny app and analyze how Central Tendency Measures behave when outliers are added to our dataset.

`shiny run --reload my_app/app.py`
